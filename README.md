# What is ArcFox?

ArcFox is a pack of firefox improvements that brings the appearance and some of the features of arc browser to firefox. Developed by a non-profit community of passionate browser enthusiats to let people experience arc through their favorite browser.

> I really recomend you to give a try on arc browser anyways.

Please refer to the [roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/betterbrowser/projects/2/views/3) to check the development or our [discord](https://discord.gg/jDASpgt68t) for helps and leaks :D

# Installation
- Download the extension from [the Firefox Add-ons page](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/arcfox/).
- Remember to check **Run in Private Windows**.
- Type <a href="about:config">"about:config"</a> in the url bar and press enter.
- Click on **Accept the Risk and Continue**.
- Search for `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets` and set the value to `true`.
- Type <a href="about:support">"about:support"</a> in the url bar and click on **Open Directory** at **Profile Directory**.
- Inside your Profile Directory, search for a folder called `chrome`. If you don't find it, create one.
- Inside your `chrome` folder, drop <a href="https://github.com/betterbrowser/arcfox/releases/latest/download/userChrome.css">the `userChrome.css` file of the latest release</a>.
- Re-open Firefox.

# Removing ArcFox
- Remove `(Firefox Profile)/chrome/userChrome.css`.
- Remove the 'ArcFox' extension from Firefox.
- Re-open Firefox and it should be gone.
- Be happy with your now boring and unproductive Firefox!
